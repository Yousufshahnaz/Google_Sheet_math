Google_Sheet_math (PRE - ALPHA)
=================

Provides (or it will after the PRE - ALPHA stage, I anticipate a few months) common mathematical functions 
found in engineering and science to google sheets users.

This is just getting started ( as of 9/24/2014).

I have some high hopes for this repo. 
I really hope some other engineers or scientists will see promise in a google add-on like this and fork me.
I will be adding plenty of other functions into the single .jsfile that I currently have set up.

google sheets has some amazing promise in the engineering field for its ability to effectivly replace a microsoft office framework
and provide a scripting and editing interface where fuctions can be easily written. I am very accustomed to the agony of dealing
with python and excel to achieve the same effect. I recently began learning javascript and saw that google sheets add-ons 
catering to scientists and engineers were baisically non-existant. So... lets change that.
